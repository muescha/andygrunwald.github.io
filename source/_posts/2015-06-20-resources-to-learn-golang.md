Since some time i am fascinated by the [go programing language](http://golang.org/) launched by Google in 2009.
I am a person with a scripting language background ([PHP](http://php.net/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)) and was motivated to learn a new programing language.
I chose go(lang), because i wanted to do some system programing with concurrency support.

Because i share my love with my friends and colleagues i am often asked *How do i start with Go?* or *Do you got some good resources to learn Go?*.
This article is about which resources i used to learn Go.

1. The [A Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/) is the best start. It provides an overview about the syntax and the features in a short way.
2. The book [Go in Action](http://www.goinactionbook.com/) is a good recommendation to get some backgrounds, best practices, pitfalls and usecases for language features. Even it is a MEAP this is worth to read.
3. The guide for golang: [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). It describes all features with backgrounds and examples.
4. Read foreign go code of projects like [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker), [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) or [termius](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/terminus).

And of course: Next to this **start your own Go project**.
I recomment to start with it after you finished the [A Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/) and during reading [Go in Action](http://www.goinactionbook.com/).

Some ideas for a project:

* A small rest API (http server)
* A small chat client (sockets)
* A small web / mailinglist crawler (concurrency)

Further useful resources are:

* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) for example code how to use different features
* [Golang weekly](http://golangweekly.com/) to keep updates of the Go community by email
* [/r/golang](http://www.reddit.com/r/golang) to follow the reddit community about Go
* [golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts) the official golang user mailinglist
* [avelino/awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) to get a curated list of awesome Go frameworks, libraries and software

And now: **Have fun** during learn a new programing language!
