Hi, i am Andy. Nice to meet you. 

I am a **Software Engineer from [Duisburg, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/ecvZCGWvtkx)**. 
I love the idea of open source, have fun to solve tricky problems and **enjoy working with motivated people**.
Deploy solutions and get them out of the door as well as empower people and share knowledge via mentoring and public speaking, keeps me motivated.

In my current job i **lead the Software Operations team at [trivago](http://www.trivago.com/)** in [Düsseldorf, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/Bq1SdUiESRn).
This team is doing Site Reliability and Platform engineering for the hotelsearch, the core product of trivago.

I **organize the [PHP Usergroup Düsseldorf](http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Duesseldorf/)** on a monthly basis.
This local meetup presents exciting talks about various topics from the web developer community.
Feel free to join us next time.
