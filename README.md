My website [andygrunwald.com](http://andygrunwald.com) based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Most of the following chapters are for the future me, who is not able to remember all things.

## Requirements

Install x on your machine [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

On Mac

```
$ brew install hugo
```

## Start the server

```
$ hugo server
```

## New blog post

```
$ hugo new post/resources-to-learn-golang.md
```

## Theme

The basement was the [hugo-type-theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-type-theme).
Thank you for this!

Right now we are running revision [c7bc015](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-type-theme/commit/c7bc01590bbfd6dbae5310ad0c3a44360976cab4) of this theme.

### But why an existing theme? Why not a custom, unique one?

To be honest? I am more into backend development.
I am able to write HTML and CSS, but i am far away from good at it.

Next to it, i like the type them.
Clean, good font size, not so many details.
Enough to focus on the content (and this is what matters in my opinion).

So i save time to use something existing what i like.
And up to now this was not a mistake or there were no disadvantages :)

## And all the rest ...

... can be found in the [documentation of Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/).
